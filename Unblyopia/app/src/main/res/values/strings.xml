    <string name="about_text">Delaze is a virtual reality app that treats amblyopia (lazy eye) by encouraging binocular vision.Using Google Cardboard, the app delivers treatment that was previously expensive and unavailable to the public.\nHistorically, lazy eye has only been treatable in children from ages 3-12 through the extended use of eye patches. There were no treatments available to adults, and the eye patch method sometimes didn\'t even work for children.\n\nThere are two game controls available: Head Tracking and Volume Keys. This can be changed in the Settings dialog\n Head tracking tracks changes in the direction you are facing and moves the tetris blocks accordingly, this requires you to pivot on the spot, so make sure you are in an open area free of trip hazards!\nIn Volume Keys mode, pressing the UP Volume key moves the tetris block left and pressing the DOWN Volume key moves the tetris block to the right</string>
